# rpi_motiondetection

Motion Detection Camera

Currently a work in Progress

Works as is, however nowhere near a fully complete project. 

This repo will contain all of the necessary components to turn an RPI Zero W into a wifi enabled motion detection camera.

Changes to be implemented:

- Error catching code
- Hardware designs
- Threaded server connection to handle multiple cameras
- Chnages for RPI
